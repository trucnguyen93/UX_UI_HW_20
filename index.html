    <h2>Mississauga Humane Society</h2>
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>The Mississauga Humane Society is a local non-profit animal shelter dedicated to rehoming cats and dogs in need. Their current website lacks cohesion and content structure causing the mission and the animals to be missed and the user to abandon the site before even considering adopting through them.</p>

    <h3>Existing State</h3>
    <p>The existing experience lacks a number of UI standards creating inconsistency across the site. These include: no grid system, colour inconsistency across pages, too much white space, lots of text on subpages and lack of visuals. In addition to the UI inconsistencies, the animals and adoption processes are not prominently featured and there is little content above the fold of the homepage.<span class="bold"> This negatively impacts user engagement leading to users abandoning before exploring adopt or foster options </span></p>

    <h2>Persona & Research</h2>
    <p>During the initial research into our non-profit, we had our own hypothesis about what was wrong with the current Mississauga Humane Society website, but we took this to user testing to gather insights. The insights confirmed our hypothesis that <span class="bold"> most users looking to adopt a pet will choose their shelter based on the pets available </span> and that the Mississauga Humane Society's website <span class="bold"> confusion and does not feature pets upfront, which causes users to abandon the site. </span> 
<br>
        We used these insights to create a user persona, Amy Pets. Her goals were to adopt a furry animal member, and her frustrations include sites that do not have optimized navigation. We used heuristic analyses, competitor analysis, and surveys to gather more insights about the common pain points in the user journey to apply for a pet.</p>

    <h3>The Problem:</h3>
    <p>How might we increase adoption rates and reduce friction for potential pet owners to ensure a seamless and convenient adoption experience?</p>

    <h2>Ideating the New User Journey</h2>
    <p>We each contributed our own initial paper prototype designs, then collaborated using a dot-voting exercise to vote on the best features of each design. We incorporated all the features we intended to keep and divided the user journey into separate sections to work on individually. I prototyped the adoption application pages.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="style">
        <p>Before breaking off we also designed a preliminary style tile to align on a colour palette, typography, and general design aesthetic to apply to our low-fidelity wireframes. We decided on a <span class="bold"> colour palette that anchored on green, to represent new beginnings and growth; reflecting the Mississauga Humane Society's mission.</span></p>

    </div>
    <div class="testing">
        <p>When everyone completed their sections of the user journey, we came together to prototype the whole journey together. With a working prototype of the user journey, we created a Maze.co test to see the usability in action. </p>
        <p>Some top insights and iterations we made following the usability tests include </p>
        <ol>
            <li>moving the adoption process further up on the page</li>
            <li>aligning text boxes to the left to follow the way users typically read from left to right</li>
            <li>moving the filters for cat/dog closer to the pictures of the animals rather than near the primary navigation which seemed to confuse users.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="images/maze_report-mission1-screen1-optimal-path 1.svg">
        <p>We made iterations to our wireframes and applied our style guide using alll the components we created during our prototyping. We set up another user-testing round to evaluate our hi-fidelity version of the prototype.</p>
